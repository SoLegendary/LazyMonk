// Unfortunately, the WoW API cannot retrieve keybindings for specific spells,
// only keybindings for actionbar buttons (ie. we can get the location of a
// keybinding on the actionbar but not what spell is placed in that location)

// For LazyMonk to display a spell keybinding, you must manually input them here
// If you don't have a particular spell then don't worry about writing anything
